# taylor_series
heya I was practicing my C/C++ skills by creating SIN(X) function
The Functions takes in two arguments - 
num, ang

Num - Number of terms of taylor series considered
Ang - Angle entered in Degrees

In my debian system, I had some issues while working with the built in <math.h> and <stdlib.h> in C. Hence I created my own power and factorial functions in the code itself.

Here is the formula I used:-

Edit:
I have added cos_taylor which prints the value of cos(x) function in a similar manner but has 2n in both power and factorial functions.
Formula used :-
